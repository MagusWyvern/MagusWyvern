## Hello there! My name is Adi Ahmad Danish

Currently studying in Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP) taking a Foundation of Technology in Information Systems course. I'm a Student Developer that loves challenging problems and finding solutions for them. Eager to strive further and learn new technologies, willing to accept advice and tips to improve.

I have worked on multiple projects from a broad field of technologies ranging from AI to Web Development Front-end libraries like Vue.js. However, I am currently leaning towards and sharpening my skills more in Python.
